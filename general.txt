mongoDB is standard data somethingorother service

NeDB - file that lives in your project structure
    imposes a structure on your project so there are no decisions re: parameters
    great place to start if you just need a little info persistence, then if you take it further you go to mongoDB

At some point when you start to use a "real" database like mongoDB its mostly free, up to a certain point.

cassie uses MongoDB Atlas for p5 web editor for example
